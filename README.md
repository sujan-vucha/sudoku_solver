# sudoku_solver
solves the famous sudoku with backtracing and recursion
Backtracing:
  1)Step-by-step exploration: Tries all possible solutions by making decisions at each stage.
  2)Recursion: Uses a recursive approach to go through each option and backtrack if it leads to a dead end.
  3)Pruning: Cuts off unpromising paths early to avoid unnecessary work.
  4)Problem-solving: Commonly used in puzzles (like Sudoku or N-Queens), combinatorial problems, and optimization tasks.
  5)Flexibility: Can adapt to various problem constraints and find all solutions or the best one.
