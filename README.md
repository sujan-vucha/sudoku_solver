Sudoku Solver with Backtracking
This project solves the classic Sudoku puzzle using backtracking and recursion. Here's a breakdown of how backtracking works:

Step-by-step exploration: Attempts all possible solutions by making decisions at each step.
Recursion: Recursively tries different options, backtracking when a solution is invalid.
Pruning: Eliminates unpromising paths early to optimize performance.
Problem-solving: Widely used in puzzles like Sudoku, combinatorial problems, and optimization tasks.
Flexibility: Adapts to various constraints and can find all solutions or the best one.
